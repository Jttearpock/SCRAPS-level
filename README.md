# SCRAPS-level
The game SCRAPS is a "game" used by Full Sail University as an educational tool. Students like myself are taught to work within the existing game to create our own unique experience. Below is a list of what I did or did not create within this playable build.

If you hit "Esc" and teleport to the Courtyard everything ahead of you is my own creation. Basically if you can see the "Enter the Bank Vault" objective you're in the area I created. This includes the terrain, puzzle mechanics, buildings, decorative objects, lighting, and interactable objects with the exception of the levers, which I merely programmed as they were included for me to use. 

The core systems behind the scenes and the initial Outpost level were all created by others and given to myself to build off of. I had to learn how to use them to create my own objectives, checkpoints, interactive objects, and collectibles but the basic functionality was already there for me.

If you would like a more detailed list of what I created I can provide one but it felt a bit excessive to list everything.
